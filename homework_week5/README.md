## Week 5 Homework 

In this homework we'll put what we learned about Spark in practice.

For this homework we will be using the FHVHV 2021-06 data found here. [FHVHV Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/fhvhv/fhvhv_tripdata_2021-06.csv.gz )

</br></br>

### Question 1: 

**Install Spark and PySpark** 

- Install Spark
- Run PySpark
- Create a local spark session
- Execute spark.version.

**Answer**

Installed spark and pyspark on local machine (ubuntu) according to instructions [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_5_batch_processing/setup/linux.md) and [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_5_batch_processing/setup/pyspark.md)

To run pyspark, one way is to go to spark installation folder and run `bin/pyspark`. Another way, shown in the file `w5_hw.ipynb`, imports the pyspark library and creates a session using `SparkSession` from `pyspark.sql`.

```
>>> spark.version
'3.3.2'
```

### Question 2: 

**HVFHW June 2021**

Read it with Spark using the same schema as we did in the lessons.</br> 
We will use this dataset for all the remaining questions.</br>
Repartition it to 12 partitions and save it to parquet.</br>
What is the average size of the Parquet (ending with .parquet extension) Files that were created (in MB)? Select the answer which most closely matches.</br>

**Answer**

See `w5_hw.ipynb` for code

24 MB

</br></br>

### Question 3: 

**Count records**  

How many taxi trips were there on June 15?</br></br>
Consider only trips that started on June 15.</br>

**Answer**

See `w5_hw.ipynb` for code

452,470
</br></br>

### Question 4: 

**Longest trip for each day**  

Now calculate the duration for each trip.</br>
How long was the longest trip in Hours?</br>

**Answer**

See `w5_hw.ipynb` for code

66.87 Hours
</br></br>

### Question 5: 

**User Interface**

 Sparkâ€™s User Interface which shows application's dashboard runs on which local port?</br>

**Answer**

4040
</br></br>


### Question 6: 

**Most frequent pickup location zone**

Load the zone lookup data into a temp view in Spark</br>
[Zone Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv)</br>

Using the zone lookup data and the fhvhv June 2021 data, what is the name of the most frequent pickup location zone?</br>

**Answer**

See `w5_hw.ipynb` for code
