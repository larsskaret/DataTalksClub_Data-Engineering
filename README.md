# Data Engineering Zoomcamp - Lars Skaret
This repo contains my homework for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp.

Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a 10 week course hosted by DataTalks.club. [More details here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and below.

The final deliverable was to create an end to end pipeline. Showcasing what I have learned and choosing the data source and software tools freely.
